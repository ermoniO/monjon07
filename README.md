- 👋 Hi, I’m <b>@monjon07</b>
- 👀 I’m interested in a little bit of everything, but I have a newfound passion in software development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming with The Odin Project. I have been recently accepted to Generation's Fullstack program so I am           well on my way!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, I am a newbie 😉
- 📫 How to reach me, I guess we cannot send messages here huh? 😅
